## Technical Details

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces with components and hooks.
- **React Router:** Used for managing navigation and dynamic routing within the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and clean user interfaces.
- **Dogs API:** A free API providing dog images with no authentication required.
- **React Icons:** Provides scalable icons for UI enhancements.

### API Integration

The application integrates with the [Dogs API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch random dog images. The API's simplicity and ease of use make it ideal for learning and experimentation.

- Example Endpoint:
```bash
GET https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/6
```

This endpoint fetches six random dog images, which are displayed in the image grid.

## Approach and Workflow

1. **Fetching and Displaying Data:**
 - The application uses React's `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the Dogs API upon component mount.
 - The `useState` hook is used to manage and display the fetched data dynamically.

2. **Dynamic Routing with React Router:**
 - Users can navigate between the grid and the detailed view of individual images.
 - The URL dynamically updates based on the selected image, ensuring a seamless navigation experience.

3. **Interactive UI with Customization:**
 - A background color picker in the detailed view enhances interactivity by allowing users to personalize the display.

4. **Responsive Design:**
 - Tailwind CSS ensures the application is fully responsive across devices, delivering a consistent user experience.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Dynamic State Management:**
 - **Challenge:** Keeping the application state in sync with dynamic routing.
 - **Solution:** Used React Router's `useNavigate` hooks to manage state based on URL changes.

2. **Image Loading Performance:**
 - **Challenge:** Ensuring images load efficiently without slowing down the UI.
 - **Solution:** Implemented lazy loading for images to optimize performance.

3. **Styling and Responsiveness:**
 - **Challenge:** Designing a UI that works across different screen sizes.
 - **Solution:** Utilized Tailwind CSS for creating a responsive, mobile-friendly layout.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add Filter Options:**
 - Allow users to filter images by breed or category.

2. **Enhanced Background Customization:**
 - Add a gradient picker or advanced color options for more customization.
